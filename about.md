# About Me

I'm a college student at Rose-Hulman Institue of Technology studying computer science, math, and cybersecurity.  

Some interests of mine include:
- Cryptology
	- Hopefully I find a topic worthy of a senior thesis. Possible topics I've considered in passing include:
		- <span class="secondaryclass">Sudoku based encryption</span> as initially seen [in this arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10119). "Sudoku based encryption" already sounds intruiging, and applying it beyond images/video/audio.
		- <span class="secondaryclass">Lattice based encryption</span>, particularly how implementation mistakes could be exploited. If my own experience of implementing [Kangaroo12](https://keccak.team/kangarootwelve.html) holds any weight, its *really* easy to mess up implementation of what's otherwise secure. This could be generalized to just looking at potential implementation flaws in FIPS 203-205.
- Vulnerability analysis
	- (cont. when in more of a writing mood)
- Bad "malware"
	- (also cont. when in more of a writing mood)
	- Sometimes I write really terrible scripts to run on my friends computers. Luckily I am not good at writing malicious code so I still have those friends :D

I can be contacted via email (sikalieb (at) rhit (dot) edu) for my resume.
